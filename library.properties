# The category of your library, must be one (or many) of the following:
#   "3D"            "Animation"     "Compilations"      "Data"

#   "Sound"         "Utilities"     "Typography"        "Video & Vision"

# If a value other than those listed is used, your library will listed as "Other."

# A short sentence (fragment) to summarize the library's function. This will be
# shown from inside the PDE when the library is being installed. Avoid repeating
# the name of your library here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant like
# mentioning that its a library.
sentence = A range of classes and methods for exploring Cellular Automata

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your library only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.
paragraph = Prvodies 1d and 2d cellular automata classes in a number of different enviroments such as rectangular, cylinderical and moebius grids. Highly extensible.

# Links in the 'sentence' and 'paragraph' attributes can be inserted using the
# same syntax as for authors. That is, [here is a link to Processing](http://processing.org/)


# A version number that increments once with each release. This
# is used to compare different versions of the same library, and
# check if an update is available. You should think of it as a
# counter, counting the total number of releases you've had.
version = 1  # This must be parsable as an int

# The version as the user will see it. If blank, the version attribute will be used here
prettyVersion = 0.1.1  # This is treated as a String
